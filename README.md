# Rose UI

SPA built with Create React App that now enforces Auth0 authentication via the redirect flow using `@auth0/auth0-spa-js`.

## Auth0 Authentication Setup

Create a `.env` file (or otherwise inject build-time variables) with the following values from your Auth0 tenant:

```
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-tenant.us.auth0.com
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID={spaClientId}
REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://{yourApiIdentifier}   # optional but recommended
REACT_APP_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI=https://{yourAppDomain}/auth/callback
REACT_APP_AUTH0_SCOPE=openid profile email
```

During development you can set `REACT_APP_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`. The app will automatically redirect unauthenticated visitors to Auth0 and persist tokens in `localStorage`.

Install dependencies (including `@auth0/auth0-spa-js`) with:

```bash
npm install
```

When the SPA loads it will redirect to Auth0 for sign-in. Authenticated requests pull an access token from Auth0 and call the Flask backend's `/api/chat` endpoint with it, so make sure `REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE` matches the API identifier configured in Auth0 and that the Flask service is reachable at the same origin or proxied accordingly.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
